    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 6, 2026</p>

    <p>Weight Stats Journey ("the App") is developed by Rodney Hughey ("we", "our", "us"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.</strong> All data you enter into the App — including weight entries, body measurements, habits, meal logs, progress photos, and fasting records — is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.</p>

    <h2>Apple Health</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may read and write weight and body measurement data to Apple Health (HealthKit). This data is exchanged directly between the App and Apple Health on your device. We never have access to your Health data.</p>

    <h2>Progress Photos</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may access your device camera and photo library to capture and store progress photos. These photos are stored locally on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or access your photos.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional subscriptions managed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or process any payment information. All subscription transactions are handled by Apple. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how Apple handles your purchase data.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. We do not collect usage data, crash reports, or device information.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose your data to any third parties. Period.</p>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>The App provides features to export your data as CSV or PDF files. These exports are generated locally on your device and shared using the standard iOS share sheet. We do not receive copies of your exported data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
