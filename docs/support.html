    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I log my weight?</strong>
        <p>Open the app and you'll see the "Today" tab. If you haven't weighed in today, a weigh-in card will appear at the top. Enter your weight and optionally add a note, then tap Save.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Is my data private?</strong>
        <p>Yes. All your data is stored locally on your device. We don't have servers, we don't collect your data, and we never sell anything to anyone. Your weight, photos, and habits stay on your iPhone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How does Apple Health sync work?</strong>
        <p>When you grant permission, Weight Stats Journey can read your existing weight data from Apple Health and write new entries back. This happens directly on your device — the data never leaves your phone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I cancel my subscription?</strong>
        <p>Go to Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions on your iPhone, find Weight Stats Journey, and tap Cancel Subscription. You'll keep Pro access until the end of your current billing period.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>I'm not seeing my subscription / features are locked</strong>
        <p>Try these steps: (1) Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID you used to subscribe. (2) Go to the "More" tab → Subscription section and tap "Restore Purchases." (3) Restart the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Can I export my data?</strong>
        <p>Yes! Go to the "More" tab → Data section. You can export your data as CSV (for spreadsheets) or generate a PDF progress report.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What happens if I delete the app?</strong>
        <p>Your data is stored locally, so deleting the app will remove your data. We recommend exporting your data before uninstalling. If you've synced with Apple Health, your weight entries will still be available there.</p>
